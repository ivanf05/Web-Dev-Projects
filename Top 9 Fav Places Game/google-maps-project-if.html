		<h1>Project 3</h1>
		<p>
			Project 3 allowed me to create an application using Google maps, something that I've always wanted todo.
			I found this program to be a little challenging at first, but with the example provided in class helped me 
			complete everything. I watched several youtube videos on Google maps on youtube that I used to do this project.
			It helped me create a function that adds the markers with information and an image. Also,overall made me better 
			at programming in Javascript. I was able to complete the whole project. I got the hints to display based on how far
			the user was from the location. Once the location is found, a button pops up and set's the map back to default and 
			the next location is to be found. Also, this button increments the score. Once, the all the locations are found, a 
			message pops up congratulating the winner. I validated all the files and only had a couple errors in the project3_h.html 
			file. I was unable to change them because it would mess with the functionality of the game. Overall I enjoyed working on 
			the project and learned alot.

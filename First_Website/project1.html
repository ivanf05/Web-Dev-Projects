		<h3 id = "ap">Amateur vs Professional Boxing </h3>
			<h5> Amateur Boxing</h5>
			<p>
				Also called Olympic Boxing. Fighter's usually fight with 12 or 10 oz. gloves. 
				Headgears are wore by the boxers in order to protect
				head or brain injuries. Fights are short with three 4 minute rounds.
			</p>
			<h5> Professional Boxing</h5>
			<p>
				In Professional boxing, the average high-level fight is 12 3 minute rounds with a 1 minute break in between rounds. Fighters fight without 
				headgear, which makes it a more dangerous compared to the Amateurs. Small gloves such as 8 or 10 oz. gloves are used. Fighters get paid per 
				fight based on the amount of tickets sold or for the amount of ppv events sold. Other sources of income come from sponsorships, Boxing 
				Federation etc.

		<!--Different Fighting styles -->
		<h3>Fighting Styles</h3>
			<p>
				There are three main fighting styles: the inside fighter, outside fighter, and the slugger.
			</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				An insider fighter is someone who fights in close combat. Typically fights in boxing shell and always is engaged close. Usually remains like this
				most of the fight.
			</li>
	
			<li>
				An outside fighter(also known as the boxer) is someone who fights in faraway and close combat. Boxers combinations are set up, has good
				footwork,and good defense. After the combination is over, the fighter steps out to far combat (on the outside).
			</li>
			<li>
				A slugger is someone rushes fowards nonstop,constantly throws power punches. This doesn't really involved technique and 
				the main goal is to knockout the opponent.
			</li>
